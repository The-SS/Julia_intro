# Running these scripts

The scripts were tested with python3.7.4 on Ubuntu 18.04.

### Run
Navigate to this folder (`python`) and run the scripts as such:
```
./matrix_inversion.py
```
Make sure that the script is an executable. If not just run:
```
chmod +x matrix_inversion.py
```
where `matrix_inversion` can be replaced with any other python file name.
