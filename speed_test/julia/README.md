# Running these scripts

The scripts were tested with Julia 1.2.0 on Ubuntu 18.04.

### Run
Run these scripts the same way you would run any other Julia scripts. One option is to navigate to this folder (`julia`) and run in a terminal:
```
julia for_loops.jl
```
or replace the script name by any other script name.
